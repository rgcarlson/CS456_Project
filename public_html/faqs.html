            <h2> Boat Owner FAQS</h2></br>
        <p>
        <h3>Can I be a boat owner and a service provider with the same account?</h3>
<p>Yes, once you sign up either a Boat Owner or a Service Provider, you will be able to add additional roles once your account is set up.  By going to the More button located at the bottom right hand corner of the app you can choose to “Add/Change Role” which will allow you to set up an additional role.  This will also allow you to change from one role to another.  
</br></br>
<h3>What is a boat manager?</h3>
<p>A boat manager is anyone who you choose to help you manage your boat’s maintenance.  This person would have access to all projects and be able to create projects.</p>
</br></br>
<h3>Can my co-owner sign up and add projects?</h3>
<p>Yes, they are able to add/delete and complete projects. </p>
</br></br>
<h3>What options do I have to pay for a project?</h3>
<p>We currently support Visa, MC and EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) or ACH (Automated Clearing House). There are some fees associated with a credit card purchase (3% of purchase) and 0.8% with a cap of $5 per ACH payment – this payment comes directly from your checking account.</p>
</br></br>
<h3>How do I verify the work has been completed and verify?</h3>
<p>You are able see video, photographs and text via the chat function within the project.  We recommend that you work with your service provider on the best way to communicate and agree what completion means to both of you. </p>
</br></br>
<h3>What is a verified review?</h3>
<p>A verified review is a review by a customer who has completed a project with the Service Provider</p>
</br></br>
<h3>How does the Referral & Credit work?</h3>
<p>We encourage boat owners to ask their Service Providers to register on the FirstMate Services App.  You can either invite your Service Provider using the links within the app or give the Service Provider your Referral code.  Once the Service Provider registers and uses your Referral code you will receive a $25 credit for your next project that you do through the app.  There is a limit of $100 of credit for each Boat Owner (4 referrals).</p>
</br></br>
<h3>Can I request quote from multiple SPs at the same time?</h3>
<p>We highly recommend requesting quotes from more than one Service Provider.</p></br></br>

<h3>What do I do if I get multiple quotes?</h3>
<p>We recommend that you review each quote and read the reviews of each of the Service Providers to help you make the best decision as to 
    which Service Provider is the right one to help you with this specific project.</p>
